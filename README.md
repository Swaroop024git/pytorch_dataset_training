# PyTorch Training Project

This project is designed to provide a simple framework for training a model using PyTorch. It includes a dataset class, a model class, and a training script to facilitate the training process.

## Installation

To set up the project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Modify the `dataset.py` file to load and preprocess your dataset as needed.
2. **Define your model**: Customize the `model.py` file to define the architecture of your model.
3. **Train the model**: Run the training script using:

   ```
   python scripts/train.py
   ```

## Example

An example of how to use the `SimpleDataset` and `SimpleModel` can be found in the `train.py` script. Make sure to check the comments in that file for guidance on how to set up the training loop.
