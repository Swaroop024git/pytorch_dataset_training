│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── dataset.py          # Dataset loading and preprocessing
├── models
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── model.py           # Model architecture definition
├── scripts
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── train.py           # Training script
├── utils
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── utils.py           # Utility functions
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
└── README.md              # You're here!
```

## 🛠️ Installation

Getting started is super easy! Just follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Swaroop024git/pytorch_dataset_training.git
   cd pytorch_dataset_training
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

## 🚦 Usage

### 1. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - Modify the `dataset.py` file to load and preprocess your dataset. Whether it's images, text, or tabular data, this is where you make it shine!

### 2. **Define Your Model**
   - Customize the `model.py` file to define your model's architecture. Go wild with layers, activations, and optimizers!

### 3. **Train the Model**
   - Run the training script:
     ```bash
     python scripts/train.py
     ```
   - Sit back and watch your model learn! 🧠

## 🎯 Example

Check out the `train.py` script for an example of how to use the `SimpleDataset` and `SimpleModel`. The script includes a basic training loop with comments to guide you through the process.
